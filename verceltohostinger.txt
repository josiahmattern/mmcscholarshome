2. Go to DNS zone editor and remove the alias that the new subdomain has created.
3. Create a new cname with the name being whatever your subdomain is and the target being where vercel is hosting your thing.
4. Set TTL to 100 for fast upload times.
5. Go to your website on vercel and add the new domain to your list of domains on your project.
