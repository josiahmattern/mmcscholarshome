          The MMC Digital Lab Video Team creates promotional video content for MMC Scholars, the Honors & Scholars Center,
          and other organizations within the Office of Academic Enrichment. Student employees are trained how to use a DSLR
          camera with manual settings, filming and directing techniques, and how to utilize audio equipment. Additionally,
          Video Team members train and work with Adobe Premiere Pro to assemble and edit projects. Video Team members are encouraged
          to explore their interests and learn additional Video-related software, such as Adobe After Effects and Adobe Audition.
